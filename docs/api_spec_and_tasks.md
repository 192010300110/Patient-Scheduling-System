## Shared Knowledge:
```python
"""
The 'database.py' file contains functions for connecting to the database and performing CRUD operations on patient and appointment data.

The 'scheduler.py' file contains the Scheduler class, which provides methods for managing appointments, such as getting available slots, updating slot availability, prioritizing appointments, and suggesting off-peak slots.

The 'twilio_client.py' file contains the TwilioClient class, which handles communication with Twilio for sending calls, texts, and reminders to patients, as well as handling patient responses.

The 'machine_learning.py' file contains the MachineLearning class, which is responsible for training the machine learning model, predicting patient behavior, and updating the model based on patient responses.

The 'encryption.py' file contains the Encryption class, which provides methods for encrypting and decrypting patient data to ensure data privacy and security.
